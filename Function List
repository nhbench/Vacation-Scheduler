This is in a way a wish list of things the program should be able to accomplish when complete.  As a Manager I should
be able to do certain things and as an Employee I should be able to do certain things.  This is a list of those
things.  This list is by no means complete.

As a Manager I should be able to:
* See highlighted time off requests on calendar
* intuitively reject/accept time off requests
* see individual employees remaining time and status
* edit remaining time and status for irregularities
* View a list of employees who have requested off for a given date / range of dates.
* Determine the maximum number of employees that are allowed to be off at any given time
* Assign days off to an Employee to account for Training, CTE, Conferences, FML, STD/LTD, etc
* Add/remove employees from my roster
* Notify my employees if their requests for time off were approved / disapproved
* Cancel approved days off for any Employee
* Allow selected Employees permission to approve / deny days off for others.

As an Employee I should be able to:
* show my remaining sick and vacation time
* show my estimated sick/vacation time as I'm requesting time off
* mark days to request off
* allow specifying hours to request off (request partial day off?)
* It would be cool if you could participate in a shift trade, or even bid / put up shifts to bid for others
* Message manager with special requests (useful for days that should be avoided on the schedule: Classes, 
* See how many other people are off on a given date / range of dates to determine if I will be allowed to take off
* Cancel days off that I have requested (and had approved)


Nate's Thoughts:
* I would love for Becca to be able to work a more permanent schedule, but still with some flexibility. I've heard 
from several of her coworkers that they would like the same. Like, "I'm willing to work every Sat, but I don't want
to work Sun". Or "if someone doesn't want Mon I'll take it every week."

- I think this is an issue that most nurses face.  I know that many of the hospitals my wife has worked at allow the
nurses to do the scheduling and not the manager.  Of course that is based on very limited experience since she has worked
at only a small fraction of all the hosptials there are but I am wondering if maybe scheduling itself goes beyond the
scope of what we are trying to do here (which might also apply to shift trades although the might be something worth
looking into adding to this).
